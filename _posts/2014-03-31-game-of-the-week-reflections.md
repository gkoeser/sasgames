I&#8217;m enjoying the experience of a Game a Week, and wake up everyday, now, thinking about the current game I&#8217;m designing or the next week&#8217;s game.

I wanted to create a game that I could play with a standard deck of cards. I also wanted perhaps use one of my game design journal themes. One theme that I wanted to do was a Fish School with guppies, cods, squids, sharks, etc. So I had that in my mind as I started playing with a deck of cards. I knew that I wanted a &#8220;trash&#8221; power like in Dominion, and in my mind that was the shark&#8217;s power. But as I thought of the other card powers that I wanted, they didn&#8217;t line up with the Fish School theme, so I abandoned it for the moment and just played with a standard deck of cards.

I also thought about making the Prize Deck be powerful cards that you can add to your deck to make it better. I still think that would be a great variant, but also rejected that for this week as I wanted the game to be easier to pick up. In my first playtest of the game (with Clay Jeffreys) I had almost all of the rules as they stood, but with 2 key differences. In the original game, only 1s were available as reinforcement cards, but we found the totals were rarely separated by just 1. Also in the original write-up, you had to put 3 cards down, instead of the 1-3 cards. This complicates it because you have to decide and then reveal at the same time, vs flipping the cards when everyone had put 3 facedown cards. But I liked the flexibility of strategy for not having to put 3 cards down.

The name came from the inspiration of War, but my wife suggested Bid War, since it is not so much attacking, but bidding.

Overall, I&#8217;m actually fairly happy with how it turned out and I hope my next design works out as well.

I also enjoyed playing the other participant&#8217;s games:

**Other Games from Week Four**

Anastasia Salter&#8217;s game](http://selfloud.net/Boxes/ "Boxes") has great prose and had me put knowledge of text-based adventure games that I haven&#8217;t played in years. You are just exploring a single room, but I know that I began to get wet eyes as more of the backstory is revealed and the small details of her husband keeping a post-it note that says &#8220;Love you =)&#8221; and the newly widowed wife dealing with the clean-up. I really enjoyed it, but for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t find the ending as I thought I had cleaned out the room.  I also enjoyed some of her previous week games such as [My Town](http://selfloud.net/MyTown/ "My Town") , [Nowhere](http://selfloud.net/Nowhere/ "Nowhere"), and [Balance](http://selfloud.net/Balance/ "Balance").

Melissa Peterson’s game [Sagan](http://gamecognito.com/ideas/game-a-week-4.html) is a map exploration game that I have played through, but I didn&#8217;t see an ending. I got past the biggest bad guy by using my Star-stuff, but after getting to him, it was just a dead-end, not an exit. Still impressive for a week.

Dennis Ramirez’s game is a joke about the impossibility of the IRB process (which as a non-academic, I had to ask my wife to find out that it means Institutional Review Board) with [The IRB Revision Game](http://dennisisawesome.com/IRBRevisions/). Yet again, I think I broke the game, because I did play this pong like game long enough to &#8220;beat&#8221; it and got my dot passed the IRB paddle on a lucky bounce, but there wasn&#8217;t a win screen and I needed to reload to continue.

Mark Danger Chen looks to be making something neat with this [screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BkA4UAICIAAbDG9.png:large) of his Space-based cooperative game.
