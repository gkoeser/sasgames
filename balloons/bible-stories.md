I&#8217;ve been sharing Bible stories using balloons or magic as a medium for a while and I have some great examples.

Some of the stories that I&#8217;ve shared are:

&#8211; [Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego](http://sasgames.net/biblical-balloons/shadrack) (Daniel 3)

&#8211; David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17)

&#8211; Parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14)

&#8211; Jonah and the Whale (Jonah)
