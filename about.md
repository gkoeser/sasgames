Short Attention Span Games, LLC was founded in 2014 to provide entertainment and game-based learning for corporations, conferences, and events. Founded by Greg Koeser, Short Attention Span Games draws from 20 years of balloon, juggling, and magic entertainment experience, 16 years of corporate education experience, and 15 years of game-design experience to bring about some magical experiences.

The name comes from the idea that games shouldn&#8217;t be a hurdle to get involved. The games we create are intuitive and described in a few sentences with perhaps a player aide to go through the basics of the games.
