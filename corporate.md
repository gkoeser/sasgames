Short Attention Span Games uses games, activities, jolts, balloon twisting, magic, improv theater and more to make learning stick. SASGames leads activity-based training with a facilitated debrief.

SASGames now also uses the Award-winning training game &#8220;TeamUp&#8221; for effective communication, collaboration in teams, conducting and receiving leadership training and coaching, and for problem solving in teams. Teams collaboratively solve problems, obstacles and challenges in an avatar-based 3-D environment.

&nbsp;



Short Attention Span Games is also great for conferences. We have partnered with GeoTeaming (<http://geoteaming.com/>) for GPS-based teambuilding, competition, or cooperation. Have a GPS exploration of your conference city, perhaps with a geo-based pub crawl.

Or add an Alternate Reality Game to your conference to get your newcomers more involved.  Short Attention Span Games has created some unique experiences to help conferences go beyond the schedule.
