Short Attention Span Games uses games, activities, jolts, balloon twisting, magic, improv theater and more to make learning stick. SASGames leads activity-based training with a facilitated debrief.

We create custom games (usually card, board, classroom, or casual computer game) for your event. We have created / facilitated games for:
* Project Kick-offs
* Corporate training events
* Project Go-Live events
* Corporate holiday parties
* New Employee Orientations
* Corporate Mergers

We can either facilitate the games at the event ourselves, or design the experience and pass the torch with a train-the-facilitator session.
